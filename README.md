# LxCrypt

LxCrypt is a tool to securely encrypt files. It's very easy to use and doesn't require any knowledge.

## Instruction

1. Download the Application from the [Releases](https://github.com/LioX7/LxCrypt/releases).
2. Run the application. The folder of the downloaded file is not important.
3. Select between Encrypt and Decrypt in the drop-down menu.
4. Drag and Drop your file which you want to encrypt or decrypt into the application window. If this doesn't work, enter the file path manually.
5. The application will ask you to enter or create a password.
6. Use the drop-down menu to choose the path where you want to save your new file.
7. If you encrypt a file, you will get a IV which you need to decrypt the file. Else the application will ask for the IV which you got while encrypting.

## Why should i use exactly this tool?

- 100% open-source [Everybody can view the source code and build the application themself]
- No data is being send to any servers. The tool is working completly local.

- We use a secure encryption algorithm. [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)

- The password you choose doesn't matter! You don't need to remember 32 character long passwords, just to stay secure. The encryption hashes your password before it gets used.
